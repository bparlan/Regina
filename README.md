# Regina

Regina is a personal assistant that I'm building to make my life easier. It suppose to run on my Android|iOs phone. I believe most of it's functions would be useful to many. But, I have more ideas than I can code myself.

**Important Note** to *anyone* who <3 readme.md

This is an under development & full of bugs project. I'm spending time on it with no regular consistency. I need someone(friend[collaborative], dreamer, coder[python]) to help me.
