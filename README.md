# Regina

Regina is a personal assistant that I'm building to make my life easier. I believe most of it's functions would be useful to many. But, I have more ideas than I can code myself.

**Important Note** to *anyone* who <3 readme.md

I need someone(friend[collaborative], dreamer, coder[python]) to:
    help.me
